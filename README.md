# Huckel
Calculating Huckel pi energies for specified molecules

The Huckel.py file runs in console, and asks the user what type of molecule they want to calculate the pi energies for.

The options correspond to the different sections of the task.

For general molecules, the user can create a .dat file consisting of the connections in the molecule each on a separate line.

For example, if in some molecule, atoms 5 and 7 were connected, one of the lines in the .dat file would be:

5 7

The .dat files given are used to calculate the energies of the pi orbitals for an Icosahedron and for Buckyball.

The .dat files do not have to be in the same folder as the .py file, as long as the full path of the .dat file is specified at runtime.
